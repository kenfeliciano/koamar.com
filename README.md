# koamar.com

> Source for koamar.com site and blog

The old koamar.com site hasn't really been anything since it was started in 1996. Now, 24 years later, it will hopefully be something. This site will be based on Gatsby and most likely have a bit of the Tailwind CSS in there as well.

This is an experiment on learning and creating in public. Fun!

## Current Status

_Mostly_ empty! The first koamar.com started on Dec 21 so I give myself at least until then to get something that doesn't look like a Gatsby Default Starter up here!

## Acknowledgments

- Licensing ideas copied from [Dan Abramov's overreacted.io blog repo](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io). I really like this idea! ðŸŽ‰ I did add one. You can tell because it is the one that doesn't make as much sense.
- [How to add dark mode to a Gatsby site | joshwcomeau.com](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/dark-mode/) Getting dark mode to work in Gatsby was indeed not so easy but I was able to get it to work thanks to Josh's work!
- [FREE hands-on course about using Git in a professional team | ooloo.io](https://ooloo.io/project/github-flow) This was great for someone who spent their working years in less distributive source code control systems.
- [Gatsby JS: Build a Blog - YouTube | skillthrive.com](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0RabRDhwwzVNhlOgQQgw6HJzXdM1MnT) This was one of the first Gatsby tutorials I went through and I learned a lot from it!
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product) I've used Microsoft OneNote for years, and still do, but Notion handles code samples much better!
- [Designing with Tailwind CSS - YouTube](https://youtu.be/21HuwjmuS7A) by [Adam Wathan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy1H38XrN7hi7wHSClfXPqQ) Going through this tutorial really got me psyched about Tailwind CSS and I felt I had a better understanding of design too. Adam goes through some thought processes as he's designing the various examples and to me, that was invaluable.
