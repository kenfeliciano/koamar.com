## Tailwind with Gatsby

I'm following my recipe again (not a chef). This information comes from [Install Tailwind CSS with Gatsby | Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/gatsby). I chose not to use `@latest` as it is specified. I had used Tailwind CSS before without doing that and I wanted to try it. It worked just fine this way. I've actually never used `@latest` before and didn't want to disrupt everything I thought I knew just yet!

```bash
npm install gatsby-plugin-postcss tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

# the -p is nice, it also creates the postcss.config.js file!
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

## A slight draft

I want(ted) this post to be draft so I looked up a best practice for implementing `draft` in Gatsby sites. I've seen where you just add draft: true (or false) to frontmatter. But, I ran into an article by lekoarts, [Adding a draft feature to your Gatsby site | LekoArts](https://www.lekoarts.de/en/blog/adding-a-draft-feature-to-your-gatsby-site), that shows how to extend the GraphQL schema so the draft frontmatter is a boolean and defaults to false if it is not supplied. I like it! Without this, I'd have to make sure there was always at least one post with draft frontmatter for GraphQL to know about it.

### Why?

Oh yeah, I want to try adding my diff feature! So, it's draft right now!
