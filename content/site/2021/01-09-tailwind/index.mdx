## Installing Tailwind CSS with Gatsby

I followed my recipe again (not a chef). This information here came from [Install Tailwind CSS with Gatsby](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/gatsby). I chose not to use `@latest` as specified. I had used Tailwind CSS before without doing that and it worked. It worked just fine this way. I've actually never used `@latest` before when installing an `npm` package and I didn't want to disrupt everything I thought I knew just yet!

```bash
npm install gatsby-plugin-postcss tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

# the -p is nice, it also creates the postcss.config.js file!
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

#### You feel a slight draft...

I wanted this post to be draft so I searched for best practice for implementing `draft` in Gatsby sites. I've seen where you just add draft: true (or false) to frontmatter. I ran into an article by lekoarts, [Adding a draft feature to your Gatsby site](https://www.lekoarts.de/en/blog/adding-a-draft-feature-to-your-gatsby-site), that shows how to extend the GraphQL schema so the draft frontmatter is a boolean and defaults to false if it is not supplied. I liked this! GraphQL can know about the frontmatter field even if it has never been used.

**_But why?_** Oh yeah, I wanted to add some code that, in my notes, I had used `diff`. The standard `diff` for [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer) loses the syntax highlighting on an inserted or deleted line. I wanted to keep the syntax highlighting! ðŸŽ‰ So, I made this post draft while I did that! Someday, this post might link to a post on adding draft frontmatter and one on implementing diff syntax highlighting! Someday... ðŸ˜­

### Continuing onward

Add `gatsby-plugin-postcss` to the array of plugins.

```diff-js:title=/gatsby.config.js
  module.exports = {
    /* Your site config here */
-   plugins: [],
+   plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-postcss`],
  }
```

Remove unused styles during production build for Tailwind.

```diff-js:title=/tailwind.config.js
  module.exports = {
-   purge: [],
+   purge: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
    darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
    theme: {
      extend: {}
    },
    variants: {},
    plugins: []
  }
```

Create the standard Tailwind CSS file. I've created a styles folder for this.

```css:title=/src/styles/global.css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

At this point, Tailwind is working and you can use Tailwind CSS classes everywhere. Next step for me was to implement a dark mode that works with Tailwind.
