Gatsby's default starter placed a lot of what I consider global style inside of `layout.css`. I knew I wanted my global styles to live at a higher level than this.

## What happens if I remove layout.css?

My first thought was to just remove `layout.css` and see what happens. My hypothesis was that it would look not-so-good. It did not! There were things in `layout.css` necessary for a somewhat pleasing site!

## App is my highest point

In my App component, I had the `ThemeProvider` component wrapping the whole site. To me, it made sense that App was where the global styles should live.

### Keeping it DRY-er

This had the added benefit of removing some code duplication! When working through the Skillthrive tutorial, [Gatsby JS: Build a Blog](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0RabRDhwwzVNhlOgQQgw6HJzXdM1MnT), I ended up with duplicate code in `gatsby-ssr.js` and `gatsby-browser.js`. Using the App component in those two files allows the code to live only in one place.

I did not want to try and convert all this CSS into Tailwind at this point since it was **mostly** already done. I knew I liked `styled-components` and I was somewhat familiar with using [createGlobalStyle](https://styled-components.com/docs/api#createglobalstyle) from styled-components. I decided to convert what I needed from layout.css into a GlobalStyles component.

## Tailwind CSS considerations

Even though I did not convert this to Tailwind CSS, I knew I was going to try and use it at some point so I nudged some values so they were Tailwind equivalents. For example, `1.45rem` became `1.5rem` which is equivalent to `m-6` in Tailwind. I did the best I could hoping it would be styled **okay**.

## Margin Spacing

<Warning>
  Future me has read about trying to do without margin spacing at all! Present me had not read about it!
</Warning>

A lot of Gatsby's initial styling used margin-bottom to separate elements. I had planned on using margin-top. I had experience with it, and to quote something from [Adam Wathan's Tailwind CSS tutorial](https://youtu.be/5byxwJce6zc):

> When you add a top margin to the element making that element move feels better to me than when you add a bottom margin to an element and that actually pushes away other content. I like the idea that the element I'm adding a class to actually changes.
>
> -- <cite>Adam Wathan</cite>

I found another article that I enjoyed that made the case for top margin.

- [CSS: margin top vs bottom (a layout trick you should know)](https://matthewjamestaylor.com/css-margin-top-vs-bottom)

I set the first-child's margin-top to 0 for the h1, h2, and p elements.

## CSS variables

I started using CSS variables right away. I must say, they are quite handy and not just for implementing dark mode! At this point, I'm only using them for colors.

## The current App component

At this point, I've removed what I thought was unnecessary, tweaked values to more match Tailwind, and altered colors to use CSS variables.

```javascript:title=src/components/App.js
import * as React from 'react'
import { ThemeProvider } from '../components'
import { createGlobalStyle } from 'styled-components'

const GlobalStyles = createGlobalStyle`
  * {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
  }
  html {
    font: 112.5%/1.5em georgia, serif, sans-serif;
  }
  body {
    background-color: var(--background);
    color: var(--text-body);
    font-family: georgia, serif;
    font-weight: normal;
    word-wrap: break-word;
    font-kerning: normal;
  }
  h1 {
    color: var(--text-header);
    font-size: 2.25rem;
    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Fira Sans, Droid Sans,
    Helvetica Neue, sans-serif;
    font-weight: bold;
    line-height: 1;
    margin-top: 1.5rem;
    &:first-child {
      margin-top: 0;
    }
  }
  h2 {
    margin-top: 1.5rem;
    color: var(--text-header);
    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Fira Sans, Droid Sans,
      Helvetica Neue, sans-serif;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    line-height: 1;    
    &:first-child {
      margin-top: 0;
    }
  }
  ul, ol {
    margin-left: 1.5rem;
    margin-top: 1.5rem;
    list-style-position: outside;
  }
  ul {
    list-style-type: disc;
  }
  p {
    margin-top: 1.5rem;
    color: var(--text-body);    
    &:first-child {
      margin-top: 0;
    }
  }
`

export const App = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <GlobalStyles />
      {children}
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

### First game against the dreaded LA Kings tomorrow!

I know it makes no sense but when in Sharks-fan-mode, I despise the LA Kings. I firmly believe that a King fan will despise the SJ Sharks as well. That's just the way it is! Meanwhile, they are both lovely teams with lovely people playing on them.

- Sharks are 4-5-1 (next to last place in the West)
- Kings are 3-6-2 (last place in the West)
