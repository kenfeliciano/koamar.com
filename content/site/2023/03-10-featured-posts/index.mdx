Much like the prior feature where I implemented most recent posts, I was hopeful to reuse _something_! I figured it would look the same but have a different header and be a slightly different query and that's it. Hrm, can I even reuse most recent posts to do this?

Looking at the main landing page, `index.js`, I saw that the concept of most recent posts is baked right into there. The concept I envisioned was exactly the same except I wanted to look into the frontmatter and pick out only posts with `featured: true`. Then sort those by most recent just like the most recent query.

Here's my plan.

- Create a `MostRecentPosts` component and move everything into it, keeping Posts as a separate component.
- Create a `FeaturedPosts` component which is a copy of `MostRecentPosts`, make the change for featured, and it should work.
- Combine both queries into a single component (named what? Names are hard!)
  - FrontPagePosts
- Add a `graphql` variable for `featured (bool)`
- Call the Posts component with featured = false for most recent
- Call the Posts component with featured = true for featured posts

## Create MostRecentPosts component

This should just work yes? No! You can't put `graphql` queries inside of pages that aren't getting created by Gatsby. Yes, that's how little I still know about Gatsby!

## Duplicate code!

Yes, finally, I get to copy and paste! I copy that whole `graphql` query so I have two queries on the main page. One is aliased with `mostRecent` and one is `featured`. Now I get two data sources for my landing page.

```jsx:title=Landing page excerpt
const IndexPage = ({ data }) => {
  const recentPosts = data.mostRecent.edges
  const featuredPosts = data.featured.edges

  // later, they are displayed using the Posts component
  <h2>Featured posts</h2>
  <Posts posts={featuredPosts} />
  <h2>Most recent posts</h2>
  <Posts posts={recentPosts} />
  //...
}
```

### Now what?

It works! Yes, there's a whole bunch of duplicate code. The whole query is duplicated minus one variable! So, how do I add a variable `$featured` that can be used in one query but not the other?

## Add the featuredOnly variable

If you pop open GraphiQL (http://localhost:8000/\_\_\_graphql), you can experiment! I know enough that to add a variable, you place it in the query _function_ name. Looks like a function! Then later, you can use it in your query.

```graphql {1,4}
query Posts($featuredOnly: Boolean) {
  featured: allMdx(
    sort: {fields: [frontmatter___date], order: [DESC]}
    filter: {frontmatter: {name: {eq: null}, draft: {eq: false}, featured: {eq: $featuredOnly}}}
    limit: 6
  ) {
  ...
```

My hope is that if I pass `true` I get the featured posts. If I pass `null` I get the most recent posts (that can include feature posts!).  
✅ `featuredOnly` = true returns only (up to) 6 featured posts  
❌ `featuredOnly` = null returns up to 6 posts featured or not (this leaves out the featured post)

But, if I just leave out the variable...  
✅ leaving out `featuredOnly` returns up to 6 posts featured or not

So, instead of passing null, I just have to leave it out.

## Implement it in code!

Now I'm at a loss. I'm looking but not finding. Searching but not seeing. Blah blah but not uh-huh! I just want to know the syntax to pass `{ featuredOnly: true }` into the query and use the same query. I tried a few things but given that the landing page is not being created as a page by Gatsby, I'm not sure what to do. Duplicate code for the win! Maybe that's why the horse is so happy![^1]

I have no idea what this picture has to do with "featured post" but it made me laugh!
