<Info>
Last time I did anything regarding building the site was Jan or perhaps Feb 2022. I was hoping it wouldn't be too difficult to change not having looked at this code, or any programming really, since then.

</Info>

## Previously on koamar.com...

The site's front page had a lovely Hero control but beyond that, it was just a blurb about what's happened so far on the site. Perhaps this stuff it was fun, silly, useful, but it didn't belong here! I want the front page to have a way to get to most recent posts, as one of a few ideas for the front page.

## Requirements

The `post-list.js` template displays all the posts for section of the site: project, blog, or site dev. That looks like a good first stab at what the front page component should be like. In a perfect world, I'd get a lot of the code that can be reused and put it into its own component.

- ✅ Display the six most recent posts from any section (based on update then created)
  - Currently, the default is two per row of grid, for the front page and that seems fine.
- ❌ **_Could_** have `content/collections/front-page` for text that appears
  - In that way, `front-page` could be a collection equivalent to the others
  - At least for the moment, I'm not going to do this.
- ❌ **_Could_** display which section the post is in on the front page
  - Not going to do this right now either!
- No need for pagination since there is always a fixed number of cards.

## Update Steps

1. Extract `Posts` to its own component so it can be reused in `index.js`
2. Add 6 most recent posts to query in `gatsby-node.js` so I can access them on the front page, this requires stealing from `post-list.js` (don't worry, I realized I didn't need to do this)
3. Delete or move the intro text about updates - moving them to the Site Development page
4. Update `Posts` component so it works for both `post-list.js` and `index.js`

### Extract Posts

`post-list.js`, displays a list of six posts, which is exactly what I want on the front page. I decide to extract that to its own component, `Posts`, and use it for the front page. It did not work as-is. I ended up duplicating some code, _for now_. The six most recent posts can cross all the collections while the current code expects everything to be in one collection.

```jsx:title=Posts.js initial extraction
import * as React from 'react'
import tw, { styled } from 'twin.macro'
import { PostCard } from '../components'

const PostContainer = styled.div(tw`grid gap-y-0 lg:grid-cols-2 lg:gap-x-4 lg:pb-4`)

export const Posts = ({ posts, collection }) => (
  <PostContainer>
    {posts.map((post) => (
      <PostCard post={post} collection={collection} key={post.node.id} />
    ))}
  </PostContainer>
)
```

```jsx:title=post-list.js {5}
// ...
      <Content>
        <h1>{site.frontmatter.title}</h1>
        {currentPage === 1 && <MDXRenderer>{site.body}</MDXRenderer>}
        <Posts posts={posts} collection={collection} />
      </Content>
// ...
```

I feel this will eventually work for the front page, but it has to send the collection a different way.

### Add query to gatsby-node.js for front page

<Warning>
I'm including this because this was a turning point for me. It may be obvious to some but:

1. You don't need to create pages in Gatsby to use GraphQL **_if_** you already have a page!

   - I have an `index.js` file that I want to populate with GraphQL
   - I don't need to do anything other than add a query to this file

2. A GraphQL query returns a `data` object!

   - I haven't had much experience getting data from APIs so the magic of `data` was not known to me. In the GraphQL query editor, you can even see the `data` object being returned. Ah well...
   - So, data just magically appears when you have a GraphQL query in a component.
   - I'm not sure I get it yet, but that's one of the magical things about JavaScript I suppose, and, I don't know all of the JavaScript magic at the moment.
   - I mean, seriously, it's just a function on the page. Nothing is running it. Perhaps it is Gatsby magic?

</Warning>

I want to have a slightly different query for most recent tasks.

1. It's a fixed number so `limit` will always be 6
2. It can cross all collections so I don't want to sort or filter by collection

I want to access the current GraphQL query that drives everything, in `gatsby-node.js` but I'll need two queries. I try adding another query and get an error. This leads me to finding out if I want two `allMdx` queries, I'm going to have to alias them. So I figure that all out. It's rather easy, only needing to put the alias in front of that part of the query.

```graphql
query CreatePagesQuery {
      front: allMdx(
        sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: [DESC] }
        filter: { frontmatter: { name: { eq: null }, draft: { eq: false } } }
        limit: 6
      )
        ...

      pages: allMdx(
        sort: { fields: [fields___collection, frontmatter___date], order: [ASC, DESC] }
      )

        ...
```

<Danger>
At this point, why didn't I notice the signature of the query was different? Why didn't I notice that I got that query from a different file? Take off the blinders Ken!

</Danger>

Then change everywhere it says `data.allMdx` to `data.pages` and everything is working just fine. **[Yep, just peachy!]**

Now, I want to access `data` on the `index.js` page but I don't see how. After cursing the magic for a bit, giving up, and trying again, I remembered I had queried things outside of `gatsby-node.js` before. Sure enough, I just had to include the new query in the `index.js` page and I could access the GraphQL data just fine!

```graphql:title=index.js GraphQL Query
export const query = graphql`
  query recentPosts {
    allMdx(
      sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: [DESC] }
      filter: { frontmatter: { name: { eq: null }, draft: { eq: false } } }
      limit: 6
    ) {
      edges {
        node {
          frontmatter {
            slug
            title
            date(formatString: "MMMM D, YYYY")
            updated(formatString: "MMMM D, YYYY")
            excerpt
            coverAlt
            coverImage {
              publicURL
              childImageSharp {
                gatsbyImageData(layout: FULL_WIDTH)
              }
            }
          }
          id
          excerpt
          fields {
            collection
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
```

It's not magic, I just lack a bit of understanding of JavaScript and/or Gatsby.

### Move intro text on updates to Site Dev page

I didn't copy and paste! I rewrote them in Markdown just so I could feel them. I didn't change much so it wasn't one of those editing epiphanies we all enjoy (right?). Perhaps I enjoy typing, perhaps I like thinking about something again. I tend to not copy and paste stuff.[^1]

### Update Posts component

Posts is passed `posts` and `collection`. If I want to reuse it, it will need to get `collection` a different way. In the case of the post-list template, it is always going to be the same collection, hence I could pass that separately. On the front page, it's not necessarily so. I'll include the collection as part of the posts result and it will work in both situations. I already had to make this change for the front page to work.

```jsx:title=Posts.js Final version
import * as React from 'react'
import tw, { styled } from 'twin.macro'
import { PostCard } from '../components'

const PostContainer = styled.div(tw`grid gap-y-0 lg:grid-cols-2 lg:gap-x-4 lg:pb-4`)

export const Posts = ({ posts }) => (
  <PostContainer>
    {posts.map((post) => (
      <PostCard post={post} collection={post.node.fields.collection} key={post.node.id} />
    ))}
  </PostContainer>
)
```

In the GraphQL for both `index.js` and `post-list.js` I added collection to the result site.

```graphql:title=Updated GraphQL Query {20-22}
) {
  edges {
    node {
      frontmatter {
        slug
        title
        date(formatString: "MMMM D, YYYY")
        updated(formatString: "MMMM D, YYYY")
        excerpt
        coverAlt
        coverImage {
          publicURL
          childImageSharp {
            gatsbyImageData(layout: FULL_WIDTH)
          }
        }
      }
      id
      excerpt
      fields {
        collection
      }
    }
  }
```

## Git is awesome

Most of my use of `git` is straight-forward, no issues, happy path, usage. Create a branch, work on it, commit, push it when done. I had committed a change to `gatsby-node.js` at one point, that I did not want anymore. At that point, I had made changes to other files. I reverted my prior commit and it only affected `gatsby-node.js` and not the other files I was working on. I didn't have to stash or anything (though i did back them up just in case). Learning is fun!
