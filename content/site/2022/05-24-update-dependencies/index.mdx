<Info>

This is a prequel! But it leads right into the next post so, this is where it will appear.

</Info>

It had been a while since I've done anything with the website. I decided it was finally time to plug in a date when I got the official Copyright. This lead me to having an Updated YAML. And then, the dependency bot went nuts! Since most everything is tied to Gatsby, I thought it would be a good idea to update. Gatsby 4 is out and I'm still on 2 at this point!

The documentation, [Migrating from v3 to v4 | Gatsby (gatsbyjs.com)](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v3-to-v4/), strongly suggests upgrading `gatsby` and all components to v3 before upgrading to v4. Okay.

## Update Gatsby From 2.x to 3

In package.json, change gatsby to ^3.0.0.

Run: `npm install`

Run: `npm outdated`

Woohoo! So many files! So, the plan is to change all of them to the _wanted_ value listed in the outdated list. I figure since this is all based on Gatsby 3.x it should be safe. There were actually a few that weren't outdated! I'm shocked.

Time passes…

I don't trust my `node_modules` folder at this point. How can I be sure of what's being used if are outdated files everywhere.

```bash
rm -r node_modules
npm install
gatsby clean
gatsby develop
```

### Errors Abound

There was much too much in the error department for me!

```
home/blah/blah/blah/node_modules/yoga-layout-prebuilt/yoga-layout/build/Release/nbind.js:53
        throw ex;
        ^
Error: Cannot find module 'webpack'
Require stack:
many things!

Node.js v17.3.1
The terminal process "/bin/zsh '-c', 'npm run develop'" terminated with exit code: 7.
```

## Try Updating to Latest of Everything

First, rollback and make sure it works.

```bash
# rolled back to last working version
# started a new branch
rm -r node_modules # still not trusting the node_modules
npm install
gatsby clean
gatsby develop
```

This should work right? It doesn't! Somehow, `node` is on v17.3.1 and there are lots of errors related to that. I've been using 16.x (LTS). I switched node to that version and now it should work right? It does! It's back to the way it was before I started _upgrading_.

### Now Update

My plan was to do `npm install package@latest` on everything. That did not work either. What do you do when you have critical errors on packages you don't control?

#### Fix the Critical One!

`xmlhttprequest-ssl` is the critical issue. It is not something I have in my `package.json`. Why is it there? Here's my first learning about npm beyond the basics. Those of you reading may thing, but this is basic too Ken, well, it wasn't for me!

```bash
npm ls xmlhttprequest-ssl
```

This tells me it is a dependency _only_ in gatsby@2.26.1. So, if I can get gatsby 2.x updated, perhaps that will be okay?

```bash
npm install gatsby --legacy-peer-deps
```

I'm hoping this will get me what I need! But, all it did was update `gatsby` from 2.26.1 -> 2.32.13. No peers were updated. But, if this worked, `xmlhttprequest-ssl` would have been updated from 1.5.5 -> 1.6.3 which would be safe!

```bash
nvm use --lts # node keeps switching to v17.
gatsby clean
gatsby develop
```

It shows the usual warnings but eventually works. This also seems to have fixed at least one of the other alerts.

- lodash is now v4.17.21
- tar@6.0.5 (needs to be >= 6.1.9) - used by gatsby-plugin-manifest (2.6.1 -> 2.12.1) This does not fix it!
- ansi-html (there is no fix)
- dns-packet (needs to be >=1.3.2) it is!
- is-svg@3.0.0 (needs to be >=4.3.0) - major, used by gatsby
- object-path (needs to be >= 0.11.8) it is!

There are more, but the gist is, updating Gatsby 2.x fixed a lot of the vulnerabilities and the site seems to still work. The site loads not-so-good but it works. Starts off with KoaMar in huge letters and then everything sort of settles down and is normal.

Now there are 8 high severity, 11 moderate severity, and 1 low severity vulnerabilities. Best I can do for now!
