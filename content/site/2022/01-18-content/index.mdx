_This one didn't go as planned!_ Jump to the end [Decisions, Decisions](#decisions,-decisions) to see the sordid details!

<Warning>

This implementation happened in Gatsby 2 days. At the moment, the site is still in Gatsby 2.

Also, I need a plugin so I can link to headings in a document which I have **_not_** installed as of yet! If you want to go to Decisions, Decisions, it's down there a bit...you'll find it!

</Warning>

## Content Configuration

- Add folders for content/blog, content/project, and content/site
- Add `filesystem` configuration in `gatsby-config.js` for these new areas
- Install and configure Mdx support for Gatsby
- Install and configure `gatsby-remark-images` as well. Some dependencies were already in there.
- Brought in a synthesizer image as a placeholder if there is no specified cover image. Probably should have a default for music, coding, blog post, site post!

### Mdx Support for Gatsby

```bash
npm install gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react mdx-utils
# probably with filesystem at the same time
npm install gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react gatsby-source-filesystem
```

```javascript:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
      options: {
        extensions: [`.mdx`, `.md`],
      },
    },
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        path: `${__dirname}/posts`,
        name: `posts`,
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

### Create Pages

Add just enough code to gather slugs and ids to create pages.

```jsx:title=gatsby-node.js
exports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions }) => {
  const { data } = await graphql(`
    query {
      allMdx(sort: { fields: frontmatter___date, order: DESC }) {
        edges {
          node {
            frontmatter {
              slug
            }
            id
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `)

  // Create single blog posts
  data.allMdx.edges.forEach((edge) => {
    const slug = edge.node.frontmatter.slug
    const id = edge.node.id
    actions.createPage({
      path: slug,
      component: require.resolve('./src/templates/blog-post.js'),
      context: { id },
    })
  })
}
```

### Blog Post Template

Create a template for all posts (like `singlePost.js`)

```jsx:title=blog-post.js
import * as React from 'react'
import { graphql } from 'gatsby'
import { MDXRenderer } from 'gatsby-plugin-mdx'
import SEO from '../components/seo'
import { Layout, CoverImage } from '../components'

const BlogPost = ({ data }) => {
  const coverImage = data.mdx.frontmatter.coverImage.childImageSharp.fluid

  return (
    <Layout>
      <SEO title={data.mdx.frontmatter.title} description={data.mdx.frontmatter.excerpt} />
      <CoverImage fluid={coverImage} />
      <h1>{data.mdx.frontmatter.title}</h1>
      <MDXRenderer>{data.mdx.body}</MDXRenderer>
    </Layout>
  )
}

export default BlogPost

export const blogQuery = graphql`
  query SinglePostQuery($id: String!) {
    mdx(id: { eq: $id }) {
      body
      frontmatter {
        date(formatString: "MM/DD/YYYY")
        excerpt
        slug
        title
        tags
        coverImage {
          publicURL
          childImageSharp {
            fluid {
              ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
            }
          }
        }
      }
      timeToRead
    }
  }
`
```

### Create CoverImage Component

Using a bit of Tailwind but not that much styling yet (like `FeatureImage.js`)

```jsx:title=CoverImage.js
import * as React from 'react'
import Img from 'gatsby-image'
import { useStaticQuery, graphql } from 'gatsby'

export const CoverImage = ({ fluid }) => {
  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    query {
      imageSharp(fluid: { originalName: { eq: "steve-harvey-xWiXi6wRLGo-unsplash.jpg" } }) {
        fluid {
          ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
        }
      }
    }
  `)

  return (
    <div className='overflow-hidden relative'>
      <Img className='absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full' fluid={fluid ? fluid : data.imageSharp.fluid} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Create Fake Content

- Added a couple of fakes to blog
- Added a very sparse fake to site and project, with no images!

## Retrospective

⬜ Links in Mdx are not styled with `ExternalLink` component. It would be nice not to have to embed that as React component and have it automatically translate the link to it. Clicking on them now does not open a new tab either.  
✅ If there is no `coverImage`, you're hosed!  
⬜ Code tests look poor - as expected  
⬜ Table test looks poor - as expected  
⬜ Post is not styled that great - Heading 1 and 2 are valid, all other headings are the same.  
⬜ Horizontal rules do not exist  
⬜ Quotes aren't happening  
⬜ Ordered lists have no numbers  
✅ filenames are off the root instead of blog/first-fake, it is /first-fake. You can enter that in the slug but it would be better not to do that!

- in `gatsby-node.js` there is code that takes the slug and creates the path for the page
- I've got example code on creating a new Node Field that could be used (collection is a good name!)

## Decisions, Decisions

<Info>

## Optional reading

Yes, I realize the whole site and in fact Internet is optional reading, but this really is! These are just some of the initial thoughts I went through when trying to figure out how to configure the site for content.

</Info>

[Back to the top!](#content-configuration)

Here's all the thought process that went into starting this one!

## Folder Structure

After studying _**numerous**_ Gatsby Blog starters (3 or 4) I've decided on the following.

`content` folder will live at the root with `src` and not in `src`.

- content/blog - All the blog posts
- content/project - All the music and coding projects
- content/site - All the site design history

What about `src/images`? It appears that is where site-wide images will go. Other images will go into the appropriate folder of the article.

As for the content folders, I think I will go with a Year folder and then have a folder inside for each post in the format (adjusted a bit): `MM-DD - Blog Post Title`. First might be in content/site/2020/12-19 - It lives

## Gatsby-source-filesystem Config

With all that in mind, should there be one file system for `content` or should there be three—one for each type: blog, project, site.

Looks like I should have three, one for each, according to a Stack Overflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50242492/gatsby-multiple-content-types). If each content type _could_ have different frontmatter structures, this would be smart. What follow are a couple of code examples.

- You can create a file type based on the source name in `gatsby-node`

```jsx:title=gatsby-node.js (excerpt)
exports.onCreateNode = ({ node, actions, getNode }) => {
  const { createNodeField } = actions
  if (node.internal.type === `MarkdownRemark` || node.internal.type === `Mdx`) {
    createNodeField({
      name: `collection`,
      node,
      // This doesn't work (without getNode being passed - I forgot!
      value: getNode(node.parent).sourceInstanceName
    });
  })
};
```

- Then you can filter the graphql query for collection of contents based on type

```graphql
query postsOnly {
  allMdx(filter: { collection: { eq: "posts" } }) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        collection
      }
      frontmatter {
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Even Better

sourceInstanceName already exists, but you cannot filter on this with allMdx (allFile, yes). But, since I got collection working above, now I have duplicate paths to the same data.

- Add to graphql query

```graphql
query {
  allMdx(sort: { fields: frontmatter___date, order: DESC }) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        frontmatter {
          slug
        }
        parent {
          ... on File {
            sourceInstanceName
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Generate the path with it

```jsx:title=gatsby-node.js (excerpt)
// Create single blog posts
data.allMdx.edges.forEach((edge) => {
  const slug = edge.node.frontmatter.slug
  const id = edge.node.id
  const collection = edge.node.parent.sourceInstanceName

  actions.createPage({
    path: `${collection}/${slug}`,
    component: require.resolve('./src/templates/blog-post.js'),
    context: { id },
  })
})
```

## Final Answer

Going with `onCreateNode` to add a collection field. It works for creating the path and it works for filtering later.

- Final GraphQL query

```graphql
query {
  allMdx(sort: { fields: frontmatter___date, order: DESC }) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        frontmatter {
          slug
        }
        fields {
          collection
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Displaying Content

### On Home Page

Home page should display feature content for blog and project. These will be sorted by featured field in frontmatter. If there is no featured field, the post/project will not appear.

**Featured Blog Posts**

- blah (1)
- blah (2)
- blah (3)

**Featured Projects**

- blah (1)
- blah (2)
- blah (3)

### On the Main Page for Content Type

For blog, project, and site main page, a reverse chronological list of posts.

### On a Tag Page

For each tag, a list of matching files of all content type with something that indicates the type. Perhaps a filter to include all or just a subset? These should be reverse chronological too.

i.e. `gatsby` tag

- Site: {Name of post}
- Blog: {Name of post}
- Project: {Name of project}
