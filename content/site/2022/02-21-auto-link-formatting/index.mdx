excerpt: Making links in Markdown content look and behave like I want
tags: [react, gatsby]

By default, links in Markdown are not styled, nor do they behave the way I'd like. If a link is external, I'd like it to open in a new window. If it is internal, I'd like it to replace the current page.

I found an implementation of a component called MarkdownLink from [zslabs](https://zslabs.com/articles/mdx-link-routing-in-gatsby). This component provides more functionality than my existing ExternalLink component and I'll use it for Mdx translations.

This just has to be added to `gatsby-browser.js` and `gatsby-ssr.js` files, under components.

```jsx {10}
const components = {
  table: Table,
  pre: (preProps) => {
    const props = preToCodeBlock(preProps)
    if (props) {
      return <Code {...props} />
    }
    return <pre {...preProps} />
  },
  a: (props) => <MarkdownLink {...props} />,
  wrapper: ({ children }) => <>{children}</>,
}
```

With this in place, an Mdx link can be normal and it will appear with the style and behavior I require.

### Issue!

Internal links, like footnotes, seem to require being clicked on twice. Perhaps that has to do with gatsby-ssr? I spent an awful long time on that. It would be ~~a shame~~ great if this was the reason it was having this issue. Sadly, it is not.
