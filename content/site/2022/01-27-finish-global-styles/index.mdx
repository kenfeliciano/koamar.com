Now that there is some content, it is easy to see the deficiencies in the Global Styles.

- [x] Add acknowledgement for Skillthrive's [Gatsby JS: Build a Blog](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW0RabRDhwwzVNhlOgQQgw6HJzXdM1MnT) tutorial to README

Went through Skillthrive code and made use of CSS in `TypographyElement` component and `PostElement` component.

Found out about using comma delimited numbers for rgb so you can alter opacity in a theme.

## Control Opacity in Theme

It's a little bit of duplication but:

1. Create a `css` variable that is a comma delimited set of numbers for your color (i.e. 0, 120, 137 â€” Shark's Teal)
2. Now, you can use this variable and control opacity using `rgba`
3. You can also set a variable for opacity per theme. Shark's Teal looks best at 0.5, Shark's Orange at 0.7 for `code` type text
4. Even though this isn't being used in the KoaMar site, the primary color with code opacity works great for table header.

```css
--primary-rgb: 0, 120, 137;
--code-opacity: 0.5;

background-color: rgba(var(--primary-rgb), .5);
background-color: rgba(var(--primary-rgb), var(--code-opacity);
```

## More content too!

Added lots of samples to [first-fake](../../blog/first-fake)

Was able to get outline styles to work in Mdx to one level. That's nice! It doesn't work in Notion ðŸ˜‰[^1]

Added some extras like footnotes and definitions as well.

[^1]: Look at the date, perhaps Notion does this now!
