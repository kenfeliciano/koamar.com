I thought it would _just work_! I thought I could just use something like this.

```markdown noLineNumbers
Jump to [Look out behind you](#look-out-behind-you)
```

Well, it did not _just work_!

## This Works

[Creating Linked Blog Post Headers using MDX on GatsbyJS. - Coner Murphy](https://conermurphy.com/blog/blog-post-linked-headers-mdx-gatsbyjs/)

- For any header, add this to components in: `MdxWrapper.js`, `gatsby-ssr.js`, & `gatsby-browser.js`

```jsx
h2: (props) => (
  <h2 id={props.children.replace(" ", "-").toLowerCase()}>
    <a
      href={`#${props.children.replace(" ", "-").toLowerCase()}`}
    >
      {props.children}
    </a>
  </h2>
),
```

<Warning>
  The code supplied will only catch the first space it finds. That works fine for two word
  headers. What if you are a little silly and right a header like, oh, "Look out behind
  you". It doesn't work there. Changed it to use RegEx (now I've got two bugs) ðŸ˜† Just
  kidding RegEx!
</Warning>

**RegEx**: `/\s/g` - Match any whitespace character in the string globally. It will iteratively
search the whole string and replace _every_ occurrence.

```jsx {2,4}
h2: (props) => (
  <h2 id={props.children.replace(/\s/g, "-").toLowerCase()}>
    <a
      href={`#${props.children.replace(/\s/g, "-").toLowerCase()}`}
    >
      {props.children}
    </a>
  </h2>
),
```

## Style These Links

These are currently not handled by the `MarkdownLink` component. As they are internal links, they should look like an Internal link.

```javascript
// Not how I normally do this. I'd normally say ../components
// and I'll probably fix that at some point.
import { InternalLink } from '.'

export const MarkdownLink = ({ href, ...rest }) {
  ...
  if (href.startsWith('#')) {
    // return <a href={href} {...rest} />
    return <InternalLink href={href} {...rest} />
  }
  ...
}
```
