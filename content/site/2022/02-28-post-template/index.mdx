## Implementation

Given all the thoughts below, it seemed like a single template would work. Currently, there is one called blog-post. Perhaps it could be called single-post in preparation for having all-posts (paged layout) later.

- rename: `blog-post.js` to `single-post.js`

<Success>


Wow, quickest, smallest commit in the whole thing! Probably what most commits should be!

</Success>


### Front Matter Updates

- Added implementation, created, and createdCirca frontmatter for date information
- Added some info to the PostTemplate to use this new frontmatter
  - **Left** Posted: {date}
  - **Center**: {time to read}
  - **Right**: Implemented: {implementation} | Written on: {created} | Written during: {createdCirca}

<Info>


This is all easily visible on every post.

</Info>


### Updates on cover images

- At this point, the images were not as crisp as wanted them to me. I tried setting picture quality to 100 but that did not work.
- I changed `coverImage` to auto-size (instead of less tall) when screen is smaller. That looks better to me.

## Thoughts on Templates and Front Matter

The three Templates for my site are:

- blog
- site
- project

**tl;dr**: All of these look about the same and I only need one template!

### Template Differences

- Site can have an implementation date
- Projects can have a created date, circa date, or date range
- Each one should have its own default coverImage

## Front Matter

I went through each type of post and made a list of required front matter. My original idea was each type of post would be different enough to warrant its own template but really, what's going to be _that_ different?

| Field          | Type        | Optional | Comments                                                            |
| -------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| title          | text        | No       |                                                                     |
| slug           | text        | No       |                                                                     |
| date           | date        | No       |                                                                     |
| featured       | int         | Yes      | Will display on main page if featured                               |
| coverImage     | text        | Yes      | Path to coverImage, uses default if none specified                  |
| excerpt        | text        | Yes      | Will use default if not specified                                   |
| tags           | array[text] | Yes      |                                                                     |
| implementation | date        | Yes      | Only for Site                                                       |
| createdCirca   | text        | Yes      | Only for projects. Circa created/composed date, could be date range |
| created        | date        | Yes      | When you know the date. Should override createdCirca                |
| updated        | date        | Yes      | Include if post is ever updated (just the latest)                   |

Other ideas that I threw away. These can all be done with tags!

- Music: style
- Music: instrumentation (tag featured instrument if there is one otherwise, big band, wind band, etc.)
- Non-Music Project: Area
