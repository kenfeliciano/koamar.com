## Pain Point

I found myself constantly scrolling up to the top of the page to toggle the dark mode toggle for testing. I finally had enough content to try React Headroom so I did. It was quite simple to add and configure.

It was a tool I had learned about while ~hoarding~ collecting knowledge. I collect a lot of information and tools that I don't have a reason for using but just the act of collecting them seems to help me. It's not always [The Collector's Fallacy](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/) in play! Well, it mostly is, but not this time!

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-headroom
```

## My Usage

```jsx:title=Layout.jsÂ (excerpt) {8-10}
import Headroom from 'react-headroom'

// Then later, I just Wrapped the header component with it.
// I'm not sure why I didn't put it in the header component...hmmm
return (
    <>
      <MenuProvider>
        <Headroom>
          <Header siteTitle={data.site.siteMetadata?.title || `Title`}
        </Headroom>
        <SiteWrapper>
        //...
        </SiteWrapper>
      </MenuProvider>
    </>
  )

```
