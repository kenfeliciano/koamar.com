I had implemented syntax highlighting with Gatsby in a test project already. Not only in the Skillthrive course, but I experimented and wrote everything up in [Creating a Code System for Gatsby](https://koamar.com/blog/create-code-system).

## Differences

- installed `mdx-utils` as the rest of the Mdx stuff was already there
- created `language-tabs.css` inside of `styles` folder
- create an App component for all `layout.css` code
- tried to add language-tabs to `global.css` with `@language-tabs;` at the end but gave up
- modified `CodeElements` to use twin.macro

## Issues

Since I'm already doing some `wrapRootElement`, I'm finding it not obvious how to add _**more**_ to it. My initial attempts resulted in a blank web site.

- Copy button for code is appearing in the header! (forgot code-layout.css)
- Copy button looks okay in dark mode but not so much in light mode
- Dark mode filenames look good but it should probably be teal, hopefully something like that can be done in light mode. Light teal background with black text?
- font-size of `1rem` look rather large. `0.9rem` is looking betterâ€¦maybe even `0.8rem`?

## Changes for KoaMar Site

- .highlight-line is some border color that is not really specified. The rest of the highlight works with the nightOwl theme

##### Attributes

Used [Raycast](https://ray.so) to toss up some syntax for the cover image!
