<Warning>

This implementation happened in Gatsby 2 days.

</Warning>

## Implementation

There was a bunch of placeholder text in the Hero component. I read an article on [DEV](https://dev.to/) that walked through creating a [responsive header in Tailwind CSS](https://dev.to/dailydevtips1/responsive-header-in-tailwind-css-2djn).

I decided to use this technique, with the Moog Modular picture that I've got as a default.

I had already mocked this up and mostly just copied the code over as-is. The colors were not correct and since it was a different font face in the mock-up, I had to adjust the font-size a bit.

## Image Component

<Warning>

During the upgrade to Gatsby 4, I removed the Image component. It is much easier to just create a static image component on the page that is using it with Gatsby 4. Jump to [Static Image Component](#static-image-component) to view this.

</Warning>

I felt _**so**_ impressed with myself (at the time!). I looked at the built-in `image.js` file that comes with the Gatsby starter kit and wondered how I could use that as a component for _**any**_ image. It didn't seem that possible unless you were passing image related data in through pageContext (as I did with the section coverImages). A quick search lead me to a question by Wes Bos! Who else is on this thread but LekoArts, Kyle Mathews, and someone new to me, Baptiste Firket. Between Wes' idea and Baptiste's solution, I was able to convert `image.js` into my `Image.js` file.

- [Using Variables in a StaticQuery Â· Gatsby](https://spectrum.chat/gatsby-js/general/using-variables-in-a-staticquery~abee4d1d-6bc4-4202-afb2-38326d91bd05)

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'
import { StaticQuery, graphql } from 'gatsby'
import Img from 'gatsby-image'

export const Image = ({
  fileName = 'steve-harvey-xWiXi6wRLGo-unsplash.jpg',
  ...rest
}) => (
  <StaticQuery
    query={graphql`
      query {
        allImageSharp {
          edges {
            node {
              fluid(maxWidth: 2400) {
                ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
                originalName
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    `}
    render={(data) => {
      const image = data.allImageSharp.edges.find(
        (edge) => edge.node.fluid.originalName === fileName
      )
      if (!image) {
        return null
      }
      return <Img fluid={image.node.fluid} {...rest} />
    }}
  />
)
```

I also wanted to be able to pass in a maxWidth but I couldn't see a way to do that and it really wasn't that important to me. In fact, I just took that out!

## Colors

I started with the primary Sharks colors for the background. They seemed a bit bright.

![Hero image with Sharks orange background and black text that says Lifelong learner, musician, retired guy, some sort of coding type](hero-sharks-orange.png)

![Hero image with Sharks teal background and white text that says Lifelong learner, musician, retired guy, some sort of coding type](hero-sharks-teal.png)

I decided to try this branded surface idea. For dark mode, this is a real thing I believe. I did not do anything official, just tossed my primary colors into [Convert a Color](http://convertacolor.com), lowered the lightness to 6% and I got a decent really dark teal. I did this for the Sharks orange color too and got a nice dark orange but that doesn't make sense for light mode. I tried 80% instead and got a very light orange.

![Hero image with a lighter version of Sharks orange background and black text that says Lifelong learner, musician, retired guy, some sort of coding type](hero-lighter-orange.png)

![Hero image with a darker version of Sharks teal background and white text that says Lifelong learner, musician, retired guy, some sort of coding type](hero-darker-teal.png)

I'm really not sure which one I like better. I almost like the light orange and the original Sharks Teal best! Hmm, I can do that with Tailwind even though I'm using CSS variables.

```jsx
<div className='bg-brandedSurface dark:bg-opposite relative h-64 m-0 overflow-hidden rounded-lg'>
```

### Color Values

```info
#007889 - Sharks Teal
#f4901e - Sharks Orange

#111a1c - Original branded surface dark mode
rgba(244, 144, 30, 0.9) - Original branded surface light mode

#001B1F - dark mode branded surface, 6% lightness
#facf9e - light mode branded surface, 80% lightness

#1D1001 - light mode, 6% luminosity, useful for code title background
```

## Static Image Component

```jsx
const Moog = () => (
  <StaticImage
    src='../images/steve-harvey-xWiXi6wRLGo-unsplash.jpg'
    alt='MOOG Modular Synthesizer - photo by Steve Harvey @ Unsplash'
    className='object-cover h-full min-w-full'
  />
)
```
