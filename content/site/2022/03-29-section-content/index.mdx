## Implementation

- Add a new `gatsby-source-filesystem` entry for sections
- Add the three `Mdx` files and cover images in there.
- In order to query for the proper file, since I'm already using the `collection` field, I added a new piece of frontmatter, `name`, to get the proper file.
- Just had to replace the existing static text with the title and body, and also pass the image to the CoverImage component.
- After that, I realized I needed my Content component
- After bringing that in, I realized my temporary formatting of posts was not going to hold up even as a temporary fix. Changing the background color from surface to container did enough of a trick for now.

### Frontmatter

**title**: string
**coverImage**: path to image

### Body

The body will be the description of the section and will appear before links to posts in the section. It should be skipped when skipping to main content I think.

### Retrospective

⬜ Add pagination component for when there are more than 6 entries  
⬜ Need light side branded surface for when there is no cover image  
⬜ Create Card components for posts and format them better, perhaps two columns for larger, one column for mobile.

- **For Mobile**
  - Picture full width of container
  - Title
  - Excerpt
  - Date - with space before

### Retrospective 2022

I do not see any future write-up of adding pagination component, working on a light side branded surface, or making any card components (at all, or even just better) in my notes. At some point, I know I did these things though cause I see this _stuff_ on the site! I guess I sort of see some of this in the prior post. Sorry everyone! You know who you are!
