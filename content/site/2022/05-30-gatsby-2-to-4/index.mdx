After watching the [GatsbyConf 2022](https://gatsbyconf.com/) presentation [Upgrading from Gatsby 2 to Gatsby 4—It's About Time](https://gatsbyconf.com/khaled-garbaya/#details), I don't feel much more ready but I'm ready to try again. One thing I noticed is [Khaled](https://khaledgarbaya.net/) _never_ did clear out `node_modules`.

## Initial run of npm outdated

Everything is Green under Wanted but going for Latest!

## Update all the things

`npm update --save` is not working for me like `yarn upgrade` did in the video. I expected everything to magically change to the newest versions. It's probably better in the long run. I headed back to the official Gatsby site migration articles.

```bash
git checkout -b update-to-gatsby-4
npm install gatsby@latest --legacy-peer-deps # to 4.10.0
npm install gatsby-image@latest # not a thing to do anymore!
```

### What changed?

- `gatsby` is now 4.10.0 but that is it, with or without the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
- `gatsby-image` is deprecated and I should be using [gatsby-plugin-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-plugin-image)

## Migrate gatsby-image to gatsby-plugin-image

Again, off to the official documentation for this. This is the usual install, configure Gatsby plugin pattern with an added _running of the codemod_. That is new to me!

- [Migrating from gatsby-image to gatsby-plugin-image | Gatsby (gatsbyjs.com)](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/image-migration-guide/)

```bash
npm install gatsby-plugin-image gatsby-plugin-sharp@latest gatsby-transformer-sharp@latest --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Configure Plugins

```javascript:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    `gatsby-plugin-image`,
    `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
    `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
  ],
}
```

### Run the codemod

```bash
npx gatsby-codemods gatsby-plugin-image <optional-path>
```

#### Message received (codemod)

> It appears you're passing a variable to your image component. We haven't changed it, but we have updated it to use the new GatsbyImage component. Please check src/components/CoverImage.js manually.

Lots of little things and I'm not sure if any of them worked. Mainly replacing `fluid { ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid}` with `gatsbyImageData(layout: FULL_WIDTH)` in graphql and then in how it is being used by `GatsbyImage` component, which automatically replaced `Img` component from old `gatsby-image`.

In Image, I had originalName in the fluid {} and I just tried moving it out since I needed it. That's not going to work I bet!

I was able to use `StaticImage` instead.

#### Manual Changes (codemod)

Not sure if I have any of this, if so, check the site

- Images using static query
- If using `src` for an SEO component, use `getSrc`

### Finishing up migration

Uninstall gatsby-image as it is no longer used. It is mentioned in a post but that's okay.

```bash
npm uninstall gatsby-image
```

All the changes, if any, to npm packages. I ran them all manually one at a time.

```bash
npm install gatsby-plugin-google-fonts@latest # no update
npm install gatsby-plugin-manifest@latest # to 4.10.0
npm install gatsby-plugin-mdx@latest # to 3.10.0
npm install gatsby-plugin-offline@latest # to 5.10.0
npm install gatsby-plugin-postcss@latest # to 5.10.0
npm install gatsby-plugin-react-helmet@latest # to 5.10.0
npm install gatsby-plugin-styled-components@latest # to 5.10.0
npm install gatsby-remark-images@latest # to 6.10.0
npm install gatsby-source-filesystem@latest # to 4.10.0
npm install mdx-utils@latest # no update
npm install @mdx-js/mdx@latest --legacy-peer-deps #  to 2.1.0 (gatsby-plugin-mdx requires v1)
npm install @mdx-js/react@latest --legacy-peer-deps # to 2.1.0 (gatsby-plugin-mdx requires v1)
npm install @tailwindcss@latest # to 3.0.23
npm install autoprefixer@latest # to 10.4.4
npm install styled-components@latest # to 5.3.3
npm install babel-plugin-styled-components@latest # to 2.0.6
npm install postcss@latest # to 8.4.12
npm install react@latest # to 17.0.2
npm install react-dom@latest # to 17.0.2
npm install prism-react-renderer@latest # to 1.3.1
npm install prop-types@latest # to 15.8.1
npm install react-headroom@latest # to 3.2.0
npm install react-helmet@latest # no update
npm install react-live@latest # to 2.4.1
npm install twin.macro@latest # to 2.8.2
npm install prettier@latest # to 2.6.0
```

<Info>

I had to rollback @mdx-js/mdx and @mdx-js/react because gatsby-plugin-mdx requires v1 of those.

</Info>

## Somehow, everything is working?

Yes, yes, I'm shocked! Besides all the `npm` installs, here's what I did.

- **Removed** `gatsby-plugin-image` from gatsby-config.js
- **Changed** `purge` to `content` in tailwind.config.js
- **Removed** Image component as it was only used in Hero component / **Removed** from components/index.js

- **Created** a Moog component that displays the main cover image inside of the Hero component

```jsx:title=Hero.js excerpt
import { StaticImage } from 'gatsby-plugin-image'

const Moog = () => (
  <StaticImage
    src='../images/steve-harvey-xWiXi6wRLGo-unsplash.jpg'
    alt='MOOG Modular Synthesizer - photo by Steve Harvey @ Unsplash'
    className='object-cover h-full min-w-full'
  />
)
```

- **Removed** absolute in Img when converting to GatsbyImage in PostCard component

### Final gatsby-image updates

In: CoverImage.js, PostCard.js, single-post.js

- **Convert** from _Img_ in `gatsby-image` to _GatsbyImage_ in `gatsby-plugin-image`

```diff
-fluid {
-  ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
-}
+gatsbyImageData(layout: FULL_WIDTH)

-<Img fluid=
+<GatsbyImage image=

// In GraphQL
childImageSharp {
-  fluid {
-    ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
-  }
+  gatsbyImageData(layout: FULL_WIDTH)
}
```

### Final npm outdated run

_These are fine, as mentioned previously, v1 is required by gatsby-plugin-mdx_

| Package       | Current | Wanted | Latest | Location                   |
| ------------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | -------------------------- |
| @mdx-js/mdx   | 1.6.22  | 1.6.22 | 2.1.0  | node_modules/@mdx-js/mdx   |
| @mdx-js/react | 1.6.22  | 1.6.22 | 2.1.0  | node_modules/@mdx-js/react |

## Everything worked locally, but...

When the Github Action ran, it failed! The error related to `styled-components`.

<Danger>

Can't resolve 'react-is' in '/home/runner/work/koamar.com/koamar.com/node_modules/styled-components/dist'

</Danger>

According to the [styled-components FAQ](https://styled-components.com/docs/faqs), styled-components now requires react-is@^16.8 (or higher hopefully). I updated that and started building again. That time, it was successful.

<Info>

**Local vs. Github**

This all worked locally. I of course tested in `gatsby develop` but also with `gatsby build`. I never saw an error related to `styled-components`!
