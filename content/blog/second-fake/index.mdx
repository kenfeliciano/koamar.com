## Ken doesn't bond with write-good

Me and write-good, using the [VS Code Write Good Linter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=travisthetechie.write-good-linter)... We're not getting along. I'm probably not going to use it but I'll annotate this with text blocks for testing purposes!

Here's some example text hoping to get some suggestions from the write-good extension. Nothing? Okay, let's try something else. How about something wimpy? Really? Try not to use the word "really" as it is a wimpy word.

<Warning>
  Well, it doesn't like the word spelled R-E-A-L-L-Y as a whole sentence or a word apparently. I tried to use it as an
  example, in quotation marks, but it still flagged it.
</Warning>

It doesn't catch crazy grammar errors. Spelling errors? How am I supposed to write good if this doesn't help me?

It took the ability to flag incorrect writing for me in certain situations. However...

<Success>Checking for lexical illusions is is fun insofar as it works.</Success>

There is something to be said for this. There are things to consider here. It must be a weasel word.

<Info>I like some of my weasel words I don't want to give them up!</Info>

I suppose I could configure it to stop warning me about weasel words and just let me know when I'm talking in passive too much. But isn't there a time for that even? Grammar Police? A little help here?

<Danger>I can't spell!</Danger>

Need a spell checker for markdown.

Oh, I have one... [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker). I hadn't turned it on. Such embarrassment...

Ah, and write-good does look at mdx files now that I've configured it.

<Primary>Go Sharks!</Primary>
