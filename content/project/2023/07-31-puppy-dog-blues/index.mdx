I was about to sit down on the piano with the intention to write _something_ and right at that moment, a dog barked outside. I instantly played the first four notes on the piano as what the dog barked.

Laughing, I started to write a blues with this motif. It ended up to be a 16-bar blues for some reason (I blame the muse as always). It was originally in the key of C but I decided it had to be in F.

This wasn't the most incredible piece of music ever written. I hesitated to even say it was a piece worth of being copyrighted, and published on the site. However, given I wrote so little, I thought it important that I at least write it down. Plus, it's not the worst thing I've ever heard. And, really, there aren't many 16-bar blues in the world.

Here are the charts. **Warning, it may be the worst thing you've ever played/heard!**
