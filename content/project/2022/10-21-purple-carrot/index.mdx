## Inspiration strikes

We're hungry, I know what I'm going to eat. I **_always_** know! My wife is ruminating, looking at the frozen food selection, muttering to herself. She sees a frozen meal that she may or may not want, and says, "Purple Carrot."

<Info>

**Not an ad!**

Apparently you can get these frozen meals from Target and other stores! There's also a delivery service but that is not pertinent to this storyâ€”such that it is.

## Silliness ensues

Upon hearing the words `purple` and `carrot` in the cadence she spoke them, I ran (walked briskly) to the piano and played the main riff of the tune. I wrote it down and we ate.

### After dinner, desert...

I added one of those bebop type bridges, but a bit different I think. I had to fix a few notes and I was done! The initial version had a bunch of altered chords but I thought I'd simplify it. It seemed to make more sense with dominant chords. I figured whoever played it would add their own alterations on it as necessary.

## The chart

I always love it when composers don't supply any instructions for a piece of music. Not sense of tempo or style. I was being sarcastic and laughing at myself but actually, it could be played as you see fit. The B section is swing. When I'm at the piano, the rest is rather funky but it should still swing (or not). Have fun!
