## The Story

It's spring 2019. We're out visiting friends and relatives with abandon. We're not wearing masks for any pandemic related reasonâ€”yet. And that's all I'm going to say on that! I know it's Easter because I wrote the idea for this piece while at my mom's house and, look at the paper! We were in a lull and some strange notes entered my head. I grabbed a piece of Easter egg note paper and wrote them down with a sketchy rhythmic idea as a twelve tone melody.

I think my original thought was to work on a twelve-tone piece but I digressed early when I wrote a few jazz chords on the paper. And that was it for 2019!

Here's the original thought of melody and rhythm I had. I'm sort of guessing and it's not that important. Mainly I wanted to use `abc` in `markdown`!

## Development

Now in spring 2020, not so much visiting, more wandering about the house and our neighborhood. I ran into the scrap of paper lying on the piano. I decide these are good bass notes. Let's put some chords on them! I'm sure the final version isn't the chords I had originally so I won't bother trying to figure out what they could be beyond those scratchings from 2019.

I thought of a little melody that might sound nice over the chords. First I had to get over that it sounded like _Some Other Time_ as played by Bill Evans. The melody is done and apart from a chord or two I'm not bonding with, the piece is done. But I let it sit a bit.

**Some Other Time by Leonard Bernstein**

I didn't know Leonard Bernstein wrote this. It's from the 1944 musical _On the Town_. I thought since it had so many qualities of Bill Evan's _Peace Piece_ that he must have written this too. I really should research the music I play more. Let's just say it is a lovely piece of music!

## Final Refinement

Still sheltering in place. We're eating a meal at the table (not the couch, the real table in the dining room). I see this piece sitting mostly done at the piano and notice that melodically, all the rhythms are fairly consistent, except the first phrase. I hop over to the piano and tweak that to match, finalize the chords, and it is done!

## Your turn!

Here's the lead sheet with versions for E<span>&#9837;</span> and B<span>&#9837;</span> instruments. If you try it out and like it, feel free to perform and/or record it. If that happens, I'd love to see/hear the performance but no pressure! I doubt it's a hit song, but if it is, and you make money, enjoy the money! There are days when I absolutely love it and there are other days where I run into a chord while soloing and wonder why I chose that one! I've yet to play it with a group but I do look forward to that. Maybe someday there will be a recording here to listen to.
