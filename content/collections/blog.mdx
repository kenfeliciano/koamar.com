Hi all! This blog will be for sharing what I learn, techniques for creating, observations, and perhaps silly stories. I really don't have a guiding principle of what goes here just yet! So far my ideas are:

- stories about tunes I've written
- ideas on getting better at creating content
- exploring strange problems I've run into and solved
- explaining topics that I did not get right away in a way that helped me understand them
- exploring magic as it relates to programming

I'd also like to write up some answers to "Why?" but hopefully that will just be sprinkled through everywhere!

I hope something that eventually makes its way here is helpful to someone! Be well!
