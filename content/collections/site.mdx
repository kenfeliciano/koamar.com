Hi all! Twenty-four years ago, a much younger man got his first and only domain, `koamar.com`. Since then, it's gone from trying out goofy things with FrontPage (I know!) to a straight up message of defeat.

Now that I'm retired, I want to keep learning and working on creative things. I'm trying to learn and create in public. Part of that, to me, is describing how this site came to be. I believe it will be a chronological journey of all the major (and some minor) milestones I've encountered. I hope there is something helpful (or humorous) for someone!

Be well!
