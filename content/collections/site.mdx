Hi all! Twenty-four years ago, a much younger man got his first and only domain, `koamar.com`. Since then, it's gone from trying out goofy things with FrontPage (I know!) to a straight up message of defeat.

Now that I'm retired, I want to keep learning and working on creative things. I'm trying to learn and create in public. Part of that, to me, is describing how this site came to be. I believe it will be a chronological journey of all the major (and some minor) milestones I've encountered. I hope there is something helpful (or humorous) for someone!

## Updates so far!

- [Dark Mode Implementation](https://koamar.com/site/tw-dark-mode) with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- A page of [code snippets](https://koamar.com/blog/code-test) for working on syntax highlighting
- A page of [Mdx content](https://koamar.com/blog/first-fake) for working out all the rest of the styling
- [Site: Initial Setup](https://koamar.com/site/initial-setup) - First post in the Site Development section!
- Navigation up and running!
- Each **_landing_** page is defined with an Mdx file. [That was fun to figure out](https://koamar.com/site/section-content).
- A hero displaying, thanks to a [lovely tutorial](https://dev.to/dailydevtips1/responsive-header-in-tailwind-css-2djn) by [Chris Bongers](https://dev.to/dailydevtips1)
- There are **now** enough Site Development posts for pagination! Is this what is called a Devlog?
- Moved all this silliness here to make way for Recent Posts on the front page.

Be well!
