Any music I compose is my music. I would love for you (yes you!) to perform it! Feel free to arrange it for any ensemble, play it anywhere or even record it and put it out there. Any sheet music is yours to take. Any performances on this site are yours to listen to, anytime, anywhere.

You don't have to check-in with me but I'd ***love*** to know you are performing one or more or get a link to a performance.

I do not want a few bars of my music used on some cooking show amongst 90 other tunes.
I do not want my tunes used for any advertisement.
I do not want my tunes used for anything political.
I do not want my tunes used for on-hold music. No matter what it is, it always sounds terrible on-hold.
