# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
name: CI

# Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
# It seems this CI runs twice when a pull_request is merged. It should only run once on the push.
# Another CI that would run when a pull_request is submitted but before it is merged would be nice.
# But, I'd want it to push to a different environment, not my production server as it is doing now!
